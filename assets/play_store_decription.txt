Subtitle: An app to help you practice counting cards.

Card Counting Companion is a free, ad-free, and open-source app built in Flutter that helps you practice counting cards without a physical deck. The app simulates real decks of cards, that you can count and check your count, whenever & wherever.

The Settings menu has 5 options. Details of each are below.

1) Decks - opens a prompt where you can change the number of decks in the shoe.

2) Reset - takes the burned card and stacks them back into the deck in order. This way, if you lose the count, you can try counting the same deck again.

3) Shuffle - shuffles the deck. By default, when you finish counting a deck, the deck shuffles.

4) Place - shows the current position in the deck.

5) Count - shows the current count of the deck. Used to check your count for accuracy.

Card counting is a simple mathematical exercise. The goal is to determine whether the next card drawn is going to be a high card, or a low card.

High cards are: 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace
Low cards are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Cards that do not affect the count: 7, 8, 9

The count starts at 0. When you see a high card, you subtract 1 from the count. When you see a low card, you add 1 to the count. When the count is high (positive with a large magnitude), there is a much higher probability that the next card drawn will be a high card than a low card. The count of a balanced deck always ends at 0.
